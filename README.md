# 14 Model-View-Controller (MVC): Tech Blog

## My Task

This project helped my understanding of Node and Handlebars. I got the backend set up using MVC structure but there are still some challenges in getting the handlebars to render information properly. Additionally, the Heroku launch did not go as planned. I made progress through troubleshooting and adjusting my config / connection, as well as adding JawsDB to my Heroku. But it still did not yield the results I hoped for.

## User Story

When completed this webpage will allow users to sign up, login and create blog posts.
